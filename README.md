## Usage

What can I do?

- Daily planner to create a schedule
- Current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- Time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm, plus additional under the banner for display purposes after hours
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (red), present(gray), or future(green)
- I can enter an event end click the save button for that time block
- Text for that event is saved in local storage even if I refresh the page
  Additional:
- I can clear the scheduler
